I"¤<p>When I was developing the idea of this Publats web page my friend Fernando, a fellow lover of ice-cold beer, was instantly inspired to get involved.</p>

<p>Therefore, he needed little convincing when I proposed the idea of La Ruta de Baka-Grau. The route is named after an infamous strip of 1980s/early 90s ecstasy-fuelled night clubs situated just outside Valencia (which every Valencian will happily tell you about with a mixture of embarrassment and pride) called: â€œLa ruta de bakalouâ€.</p>

<p>There were no illegal drugs consumed on our route, just beer and bar snacksâ€¦. â€œbooooorrrrring!â€ I here you sayâ€¦. this is probably true but look, weâ€™re in our mid-thirties and I had to be up early the next day to go to the beach so fuck off!</p>

<p>Anyway, oneâ€™s inferiority complex asideâ€¦..the only â€˜ruleâ€™ we had was that we would drink quintos (little 200ml bottles of beer) where available so that we could fit in as many bars as possible into the route.</p>

<p>In the end we managed to go to 6 barsâ€¦. but we did have 2 drinks in one of themâ€¦..rockâ€™n roll!!!</p>

<p>No hangover the next day thoughâ€¦. So in the end I had the last laughâ€¦..losers!</p>
