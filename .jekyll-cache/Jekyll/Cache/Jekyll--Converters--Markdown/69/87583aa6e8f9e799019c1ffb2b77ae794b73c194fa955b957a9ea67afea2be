<p>So this was the first and most vomit coloured bar on â€œLa Ruta de Baka-Grauâ€.</p>

<p>I often walk past the unsigned Bar Pele and think â€œhmmm I donâ€™t really fancy this bar/hmmm that bar looks shit/how does that bar survive? Etcâ€</p>

<p>However, despite itâ€™s vulgar lime green exterior it wasnâ€™t too badâ€¦ we sat on the little terrace, sipped our quinto (little beer â€“ priced â‚¬1.30 â€“ a bit above average for this area) and nibbled on some excellent cacaos (mixed nut/snack things).</p>

<p>The moral of the story? Donâ€™t judge a shitty looking bar by its vomit coloured walls.</p>

<p>Is it worth going to? Maybeâ€¦ but only if youË‹re really thirsty.</p>
