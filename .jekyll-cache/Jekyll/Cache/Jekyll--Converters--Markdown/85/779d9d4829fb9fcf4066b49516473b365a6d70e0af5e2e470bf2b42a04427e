<p>The Market Bar is a new, and welcome, addition to the CabaÃ±al scene. Itâ€™s A kind of #fakenews British/Irish style bar (which I usually #detest).</p>

<p>This bar is far enough away from the city centre to avoid the twatty (â€œItâ€™s just bants palâ€) stag/hen parties and the â€˜Iâ€™ve lived in Spain for 6 years but spend every weekend in St Patâ€™s, ainâ€™t Spain great?/did you know you can buy baked beans in Consum?â€™ crowd.</p>

<p>Despite making a bit of effort to avoid the â€˜Brits Abroadâ€™ clichÃ©â€¦ sometimes the pull of a 6 nations rugby game is too strong to resist and the Market Bar helps satisfy my need to watch 15 blokes run into 15 other blokes for 80 minutes.</p>

<p>The Market Bar has a fairly decent/slightly boring selection of multinational beer brands, comfortable seats, fucking loads of TVs, quality shitters and attentive staff. The menu is a little uninspiring, however, they do sell Sunday Roast (which I am a little scared to try).</p>

<p>The one time that I did try the food, I ordered a jacket potato with cheese and chorizo (lightly sprinkled on top rather than stuffed to the maxâ€¦ disappointingly). The potato was expertly cookedâ€¦ in the microwave (I think) but the most shocking thing, especially now that they are available in Consum, was that I couldnâ€™t fill my potato with baked beansâ€¦.. when will the Spaniards learn!?</p>
