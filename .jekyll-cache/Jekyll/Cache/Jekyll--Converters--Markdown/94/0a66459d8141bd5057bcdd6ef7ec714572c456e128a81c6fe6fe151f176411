<p>So, this is the sister bar of the popular, but slightly up its own ring, Ubik Cafe in Russafa.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s half bookshop half bar. Now, I like reading and I like drinking but rarely at the same time. It must be said however, that this bookshop/bar combo thingy is quite novelâ€¦.. ughhh sigh!</p>

<p>Anyway, despite the pretentious pricks sitting around the place sipping cafe con leche (with oat milk no doubt â€“ I had regular cow milk in my coffee before you askâ€¦ and yes Iâ€™m probably considered a pretentious prick by some people too)â€¦â€¦.. itâ€™s a really nice place and a great addition to the area.</p>

<p>The beer price is slightly higher than average with it being 3 euros for a double, but it is Tyris so itâ€™s not a big problem.</p>

<p>I need to go back to this place more and Iâ€™d recommend it if you are in the area. They have lots of events/gigs etc.</p>
