<p>When I started my Valencian love affair, around 6 years ago, I went to a bar for a takeaway coffee and the waiter put the cup in a bag for me (presumably in order to take the coffee home).</p>

<p>I asked someone about this afterwards and they said that there wasnË‹t really the culture of drinking coffee on the go in Valencia.</p>

<p>Anyway, times havenË‹t really changed that much and it is still rare to see a Valencian walking around (or even sitting on a commuter train) drinking a hot drink.</p>

<p>With this in mind I was a little surprised to find that Tallat Coffee is more takeaway/store/workshop than cafe. ItË‹s a nice spot run by friendly people (locals I think) and the coffee is good. I have the impression that it isnË‹t really a sit-in place (I could be wrong) which is a shame because it would be great to have an area inside Tallat to chill and read etc.</p>

<p>Whilst sipping my cafe con leche (â‚¬1.90) I did a little Google investigation to find out more about Tallat and discovered that they run regular events where you can try different coffees called: Cupping Club.</p>

<p>Intrigued by the word cupping, I entered it into the wonderful Urban Dictionary and this is what it said:</p>

<p>Cupping = To weigh, with oneâ€™s hands, someones testicles: â€œI was feeling bad, until Brian gave me some cupping. I felt better afterwards.â€</p>

<p>You decide whether to attend the next event or not!</p>
