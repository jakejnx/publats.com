<p>La Fabricaâ€¦. run by Grauâ€™s little horny hipster dude, this place has an interior which is sweating cool out of every orifice.</p>

<p>One time I was having dinner and I asked the waitress for a pint of beer and she said â€œweâ€™re in Spain, we donâ€™t drink pints hereâ€ which is a) a bit twatty and b) absolute bollocks because I reckon that you can drink pints in 75% of bars in Valencia.</p>

<p>The food ainâ€™t bad. At the moment itâ€™s a cross between contemporary tapas (whatever that is) and Mexican style food. I recommend the puff pastry finger that has sobrasada and cheese inside. Fucking yum!</p>

<p>Not to be confused with La Fabrica de Hielo.</p>
