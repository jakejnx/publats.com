The final stop on the world famous La Ruta de Baka-Grau, and perhaps the surprise find of the tour was the simple but effective Cafetería Sueños.
After knocking back the beers it was time to eat, we had a few decisions to make about where to go but I’m glad that we ended up in this dream bar.

The menu was a typically Spanish affair (tapas, bocadillos etc etc) but it was well cooked, tasty (I was a bit drunk) and great value. The drinks were well priced with a large, homemade, Tinto de Verano (red wine with lemonade) costing about €2.

The best part of the visit happened towards the end and has gone down in legend as the Michirones Moment of Madness.

Sitting on the table next to us was a group of locals consisting of a family and a couple of friends. They were all wasted and were finishing off the night by drinking gin and tonics. Out of nowhere, an argument erupted that went something like this:

85 year old dad: “My son has never cooked Michirones for me.”

Daughter in law: “Yes he has.”

85 year old dad: “Lies! He has never made me Michirones ever!”

Daughter in law: “Shut up you stupid old man, he’s definitely made you Michirones”

Daughter in law’s friend: “Come on, calm down.”

Daughter in law: “You shut up too!”

The 85-year-old man stands up, at this point completely red-face furious, knocking over glasses of gin and moves towards his daughter in law, finger-pointing wildly.

85 year old dad: “HE’S NEVER MADE ME FUCKING MICHIRONES, YOU BITCH!!!!”
The wasted son decides that this is the moment to step in and do the responsible thing. He leads completely fucked mum and dad towards the car and drives them home.

Daughter in law takes a sip of her gin and mutters something about Michirones. Our table is silent.

By the way, we asked the owner and yes YESSSS apparently Michirones is on their menu!
