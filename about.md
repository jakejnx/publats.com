A mission created after a drunken conversation, the aim of this blog is to sample and review every bar in the Poblats Marítims district of Valencia which includes the neighbourhoods of El Grau, Cabañal, Malvarrosa and Nazaret.

A few weeks after the aformentioned conversation I realised that it was almost certain the mission would fail due to the sheer number of bars. However, I thought fuck it… I’d try and do as many as possible.

Starting in Grau and Cabañal… (and probably never reaching Nazaret) the bars will be given a silly and largely pointless review then posted up on this blog and Instawank

.

Enjoy
